            <h2>Mechanical Keyboard</h2>
            <p>
                The mechanical keyboard is a computer peripheral device. It is a commonly used tool, especially for game players and text entry professionals.
                The mechanical keyboard has an individual switch for each key, and doesn’t use a membrane. It offers more sensitive touch feeling in pressing which is different from the ordinary common keyboard.
                Mechanical keyboards are durable, have colour-adjustable illuminance keyboards, and can get more responses when you type one key many times, so they are used to play games or write in speed.

            <h2>Gaming Mouse</h2>
            <p>
                A gaming mouse which is a graphical user interface device is becoming one of the most essential accessories to PC gamers.
                A precise and highly responsive device, gaming mice are made with high-quality sensors, multiple programmable buttons, and built with an ergonomic design.
                Gaming mice usually have adjustable DPI (dots per inch) to meet personal preference by how fast or slow the image would track when moving the mouse.
                Some have customizable LED-lit design to create an aesthetic for gaming.

            <h2>Mouse Pad</h2>
            <p>
                A mouse pad is an indispensable accessory for a mouse user. The main function of it is offering a mouse user a smooth surface to put to use.
                A computer mouse works on a surface that provides a special texture to reduce the friction between the mouse and this surface. In comparison with an ordinary desk, the surface of a mouse pad is uniform and without any bumps to help mouse movements track more precisely and accurately.
                Moreover, the surface of a mouse pad offers an individual user a larger cushion. As mentioned, they here are different types of mouse pad with distinct colours, shapes, and sizes.
                A mouse pad provided us more convenience in doing computer works.

            <h2>Gaming Monitor</h2>
            <p>
                A gaming monitor is a display panel that has been optimised to meet the requirements of gamers.
                Generally, a gaming monitor typically provides high refresh rates (for the best models, this is either 144 Hz or higher), low response times, high resolution, G-Sync or FreeSync (more on these terms later), and various other display enhancements that come together to minimise screen tearing, motion blur and other artefacts.
                The net result is a display that has great motion rendering, wide viewing angles, vivid colours, and solid control for backlighting, contrast and brightness.
                This type of display paired with an equally capable gaming PC, and some gaming-optimised software will provide you with blistering responsiveness, immersive gameplay and a genuinely satisfying gaming experience, particularly on high-end games that demand high refresh rates (to smoothen out motion handling) and high resolutions.
                These types of displays are great for fast-paced, action-oriented games as well as online competitions.
