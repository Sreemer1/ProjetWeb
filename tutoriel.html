            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your own manual on how to build your own pc! This tutorial is here with the information, and you only have to build a computer that you want, and it only benefits you if you like it, are a computer enthusiast, or if you’re new to modern technology.</p>

            <p>Taking the time to put together a machine you built yourself is a fun and rewarding experience — you’re in control of it the entire way through. You save money because you cut the middle-man out. And not only do you save money in the present, but if in a few months you wanted to update or change a component, you’d be in much better shape to do so.</p>

            <p>If you’re looking to put together your next gaming rig, your next media creation box, or an all-around, get-it-done box, this series will show you the parts, how to put it together, and the software that you need to turn a pile of parts into an actual, working, reliable all-around box.</p>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>Before you get started, make sure you’ve gathered all the tools and materials you need and prepped your workspace. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The components of your PC</li>
                <li>Screwdrivers suitable for the screws of your case and components</li>
                <li>An anti-static mat or wristband to prevent electrostatic damage to components</li>
                <li>A clean and clear workspace to assemble the components</li>
                <li>A motherboard manual to help you identify ports and connectors</li>
                <li>An adequate light source to clearly see what you are doing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Be sure to carefully follow all of the instructions that come with your hardware, especially any anti-static guidelines. When you’ve gathered everything you need, you’re ready to get started.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="montage">
            <h2>Assembly</h2>
            <p>Building a PC is simply the process of assembling the hardware components in the case in the right place and with the correct orientation. The following are the generic steps you will do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the case by removing the side panels and ensuring it's clean inside.</li>
                <li>Mount the motherboard, but make sure the holes on the motherboard align with the standoffs (small tabs inside the case) before screwing the motherboard into the standoffs.</li>
                <li>Lift the socket lever; ensure that the pentagon-shaped tab on the processor matches the corresponding slot on the motherboard, drop in the processor, and let the lever snap closed.</li>
                <li>Plug the RAM into the DIMM slots by opening their clips, sliding in the sticks of RAM into the appropriate slots, and closing the clips by pressing down firmingly.</li>
                <li>Unscrew the expansion slots if they have them, freeing the space needed for the new graphics blade, line up the card with the PCIe x16 slot, press down on top of it until you hear a satisfying ‘click’ indicating that it’s in.</li>
                <li>A hard drive or SSD installed by fitting the drive into the mounting rack and connecting it to the motherboard with a SATA cable.</li>
                <li>Plug the power supply into the motherboard, the graphics card, the hard drive or SSD, and any other component that needs electricity.</li>
                <li>Connect the data cables (SATA, USB, etc.) from the components to the motherboard.</li>
                <li>Close the case by reattaching the side panels on the chassis with screws.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Follow the steps provided with your components closely as the assembly steps can change for different models. After assembly, you’ll need to install an operating system and configure your PC.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="configuration">
            <h2>Software Configuration</h2>
            <p>Now that you have built your computer, you need it to work. To do so, here is what you should do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong> Installing a New Operating System :</strong> put your operating system disc in the optical disc drive and run the setup installation script per instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Install Drivers :</strong> Insert the installation CD that came included with your motherboard, and install your drivers. Or, download the latest drivers from the motherboard’s manufacturer’s website.</li>
                <li><strong>System Update :</strong> After the operating system is onboard, update to the latest security patches and features.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Installation :</strong> Choose, download and install the apps of choice (eg, browsers, office suite) to the secondary machine.</li>
                <li><strong>Configuring :</strong> You can designate settings for your operating system and applications to best fit your needs.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you have completed the software configuration, your PC is ready to be used !</p>
        </section>
        <section id="tests">
            <h2>Tests and Verifications</h2>
            <p>Before you start using your shiny new PC, you should test it to make sure nothing is wrong – such as noisy fans, bad network cards, etc :</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Happy: System Startup :</strong> Please turn on your PC and make sure it boots normally without error displays.</li>
                <li><strong>Make sure BIOS/UEFI is set correctly :</strong> Go into the motherboard’s BIOS/UEFI to make sure everything is set up correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>RAM Test :</strong> Use memory testing software to verify that the RAM is functioning correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Hard drive/SSD :</strong> does the drive or SSD show up and operate ?</li>
                <li><strong>Have a stress test :</strong> Your system must be put through its paces by running stress testing software to examine stability.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If there are any errors during these tests, refer to the manual or online resources for your motherboard to help you fix the issue.</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Congratulations, you just built a PC! You just followed a step-by-step guide that walked you through choosing components, assembling those components, and configuring them so as to add up to a functioning computer.</p>
            <p>However, building your own computer enables you to learn about the different parts of the computer and understand its technical aspects, and let you set up your computer to your taste. Besides, it is cheaper to have a computer you build by yourself than purchasing ready-made from a company.</p>
            <p>Back up your data frequently, and keep your PC clean (both from physical dust and the hands of software that wants to update itself). Ask questions about things you don’t understand on the internet, or take your PC to a professional.</p>
            <p>We hope you found this tutorial helpful and that you enjoyed your new DIY computer !</p>
